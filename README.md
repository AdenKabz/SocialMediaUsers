**WEEK 9 ASSIGNMENT**
**Discoveries from the Data**
    When i carried out data importation of the social media users dataset, I encountered an error (ERROR 1064 (42000) at line 1: You have an error in your SQL syntax). The dataset is also so huge and mainly solicits information about people's interests. 

**Questions and Discoveries using Excel**
Questions were asked about what interest is the most popular and which interest in the least popular?
It was discovered that fashion is the most popular interest and fitness is the least popular. Males were the majority in the dataset too.
